There are a set of steps that an organization has to follow to understand what their current positioning in adopting and utilizing open source is. 
It briefly follows this pattern:

 1. Complete an online survey:
The first step is to understand an organization's open-source maturity stage is to take an online survey.  The respondents should ideally consist of respondents from across various departments within the organization to have a broader and clearer picture of the stage they are in. This could include questions that would assess if, and how an organization utilizes open source in their current day-to-day activities. 

2. Review Output
Once the survey is completed, an output will be generated which will give the current picture of the organization on the open source maturity curve. A visualization showing the present state of maturity will also be provided along with the interpretation of the maturity definition. 

3. Current state analysis and future planning
The findings of the survey and the qualitative responses will then be used to analyze the current state the organization is on the open source maturity based on which a future roadmap will be created.

	This is done keeping in mind the goals, objectives, resources and constraints that the organization employs or could possibly encounter in the future. Most importantly, the current stage helps create the framework for mapping out the appropriate future plan for the organization to follow. It also involves determining the matrix to measure the success the organization is poised to have in its open source journey. 

4. Implementation
Once every aspect has been thoroughly assessed and all frameworks are in place to ensure maximum profitability, it is time to put it all to action in the implementation stage. This consists of implementing the actions added in the previous stage. 
The implementation stage itself is iterative, meaning that reaching the highest level on the open-source maturity model is not a once-done process.
These steps are then repeated multiple items along the way as the organization reaches closer to attaining a place at the top of the model. The results have to be measured time and again and analyzed based on the Matrix which has been defined for it and then further refined until the organization has reached the desired target stage.
