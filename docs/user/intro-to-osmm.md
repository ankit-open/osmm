The Open Source Maturity Model (OSMM) allows you to understand where your organization is on its open source journey.

By answering a series of questions, the OSMM framework evaluates your organization's open source maturity, providing a snapshot of its current stage. This stage is based on your organization's current culture, policies, processes, practices, and resources.

All the aspects of open source maturity model divided into three broad dimensions i.e. Strategy, Management and Usage. Each dimension is further sub-divided into elements:

Companies and individuals can get a sense of the open source maturity level of their organization by taking an online survey. Users answer set of questions that cover the three dimensions and their corresponding elements. At the end of the survey the user receives a summary of their responses, where those responses rank along the five maturity stages (Ad-hoc, Aware, Managed, Engaged, and Leading), as well as some charts to help visualize their organization's open source maturity.

These results are based solely upon the responses of the individual who took the survey. Of course, there will be different perspectives and levels of awareness and knowledge across the organization. A more detailed view of the organization's open source maturity is possible by contacting FINOS.

A heatmap representation of the current stage maturity model also can be availed providing the details of Dimension, Elements and the stage representation carrying the score.
