# Open Source Maturity Model (OSMM) Contribution and Governance Policies

This document describes the contribution process and governance policies of the FINOS OSMM project. The project is also governed by the [Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/), and the FINOS [IP Policy](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/governance/IP-Policy.pdf), [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/governance/Code-of-Conduct.md), [Collaborative Principles](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/governance/Collaborative-Principles.md), and [Meeting Procedures](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/governance/Meeting-Procedures.md).

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project and its communities, you agree to follow the [FINOS Code of Conduct](./Code_of_Conduct.md).

## Ways to contribute

Thank you for wanting to be a part of the Open Source Maturity Model project! We welcome all contributors and contributions. Here are some ways you can helpâ€¦

### Join the FINOS Open Source Readiness (OSR) community

The easiest way to contribute to the OSMM is to share your questions, thoughts, and experiences with the FINOS OSR community. 

The OSMM helps organizations gauge where they are on their open source journeys so they can then map out how to reach their destination and achieve their goals. By sharing your thoughts and experiences about open source readiness, you help shape future versions of the OSMM.

There are two ways to join the FINOS Open Source Readiness community:

1. Send an email to [osr+subscribe@groups.google.com](mailto:osr+subscribe@groups.google.com) to subscribe to the mailing list, and also
1. Join the `#open-source-readiness` channel on the [FINOS Slack workspace](https://finos-lf.slack.com/signup)

### Open and comment on issues

Have you found a problem with the OSMM? Have a suggestion for an improvement or new feature?

Please [open an issue](/issues/new/choose) to let us know.

It may seem like a small thing, but opening an issue is a valuable contribution. Without issues, we won't know how best to evolve the OSMM project to meet the needs of the community.

For the same reason, your feedback is also welcome on the [open issues](/issues) in this repository. Feel free to add comments or questions to any open issue. We welcome your input and assistance.

### Send a Pull Request

The OSMM project accepts changes via [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) (PR).

Before making a contribution, please take the following steps:

1. Check whether there's already an open issue related to your proposed contribution. If there is, join the discussion and propose your contribution there.
2. If there isn't already a relevant issue, create one, describing your contribution and the problem you're trying to solve.
3. Respond to any questions or suggestions raised in the issue by other developers.

Once the community has had the chance to discuss the change, [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) containing the change itself. Reference the issue (the issue number prefaced by a hashmark, for example: `#121`) in the pull request description so the community will know which problem the PR addresses.

## Governance

### Roles

The project community consists of Contributors and Maintainers:
* A **Contributor** is anyone who submits a contribution to the project. (Contributions may include code, issues, comments, documentation, media, or any combination of the above.)
* A **Maintainer** is a Contributor who, by virtue of their contribution history, has been given write access to project repositories and may merge approved contributions.
* The **Lead Maintainer** is the project's interface with the FINOS team and Board. They are responsible for approving [quarterly project reports](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/93225748/Board+Reporting+and+Program+Health+Checks) and communicating on behalf of the project. The Lead Maintainer is elected by a vote of the Maintainers. 

### Contribution Rules

Anyone is welcome to submit a contribution to the project. The rules below apply to all contributions. (The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc. in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).)

* All contributions MUST be submitted as pull requests, including contributions by Maintainers.
* All pull requests SHOULD be reviewed by a Maintainer (other than the Contributor) before being merged.
* Pull requests for non-trivial contributions SHOULD remain open for a review period sufficient to give all Maintainers a sufficient opportunity to review and comment on them.
* After the review period, if no Maintainer has an objection to the pull request, any Maintainer MAY merge it.
* If any Maintainer objects to a pull request, the Maintainers SHOULD try to come to consensus through discussion. If not consensus can be reached, any Maintainer MAY call for a vote on the contribution.

### Maintainer Voting

The Maintainers MAY hold votes only when they are unable to reach consensus on an issue. Any Maintainer MAY call a vote on a contested issue, after which Maintainers SHALL have 36 hours to register their votes. Votes SHALL take the form of "+1" (agree), "-1" (disagree), "+0" (abstain). Issues SHALL be decided by the majority of votes cast. If there is only one Maintainer, they SHALL decide any issue otherwise requiring a Maintainer vote. If a vote is tied, the Lead Maintainer MAY cast an additional tie-breaker vote.

The Maintainers SHALL decide the following matters by consensus or, if necessary, a vote:

* Contested pull requests
* Election and removal of the Lead Maintainer
* Election and removal of Maintainers

All Maintainer votes MUST be carried out transparently, with all discussion and voting occurring in public, either:

* in comments associated with the relevant issue or pull request, if applicable;
* on the project mailing list or other official public communication channel; or
* during a regular, minuted project meeting.

### Maintainer Qualifications

Any Contributor who has made a substantial contribution to the project MAY apply (or be nominated) to become a Maintainer. The existing Maintainers SHALL decide whether to approve the nomination according to the Maintainer Voting process above.

### Changes to this Document

This document MAY be amended by a vote of the Maintainers according to the Maintainer Voting process above.
